                              Heart failure does not mean that the heart is not
                              working anymore, but it needs some help to
                              function better, it is usually a chronic disease
                              whose symptoms do not cure but can be controlled
                              for many years, especially if it is detected early
                              and the appropriate treatment plan is followed,
                              this reduces complications and increases the level
                              of improvement.

                              For some reason, the heart becomes unable to pump
                              the adequate amount of blood to the rest of the
                              body, so the blood accumulates in the heart
                              chambers and retreats from it to accumulate inside
                              the lungs, causing many health problems. Also, the
                              rest of the bodyâ€™s organs are affected, because
                              the blood is its way to obtain the oxygen which is
                              necessary to complete its vital functions. <br />
                              All of this happens either as a result of weaking
                              of the heart muscle becoming unable to contract to
                              pump blood normally, or it has become more stiff
                              and cannot relax to allow the heart chambers to be
                              filled with blood. Heart failure can occur only on
                              the right side of the heart , on the left side, or
                              both. <br />
                              Heart failure may be a chronic disease whose
                              symptoms remain in the long term, and this
                              represents most cases. It can also occur suddenly
                              and acutely as a result of a heart attack or the
                              heart valves diseases, in this case, symptoms
                              usually improve in a short time.

                              Heart failure is usually happens as a result of

                              to perform its normal function, and the most
                              common disease is coronary artery disease, which
                              causes narrowing of the arteries that supply the
                              heart with blood and oxygen, and this occurs as a
                              result of the accumulation of fatty deposits in
                              the arteries and lead to lack of blood flow Blood
                              to the heart and may lead to a heart attack if a
                              complete blockage of the coronary artery occurs.

                                and needs to work harder, which will lead to its
                                weakness.

                              Heart failure can occur on the right side of the
                              heart, the left side, or both. We will also learn
                              about systolic and diastolic heart failure. <br />
                              1. Left sided Heart failure <br />
                              It is the most common type of heart failure , the
                              left ventricle, located in the lower part of the
                              left side of the heart, is responsible for pumping
                              oxygenated blood into the body. Left-sided heart
                              failure occurs when the left ventricle is unable
                              to adequately pump blood, so blood backs up and
                              accumulates in the lungs, causing difficulty
                              breathing and fluid buildup in the body. <br />
                              2. Right sided heart failure <br />
                              The right ventricle is responsible for pumping
                              deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
                              where gas exchange occurs and is blood is loaded
                              with oxygen, Right sided heart failure occurs when
                              the right ventricle becomes unable to perform its
                              function. It usually occurs as a result of failure
                              of the left side of the heart muscle and fluid
                              buildup in the lungs, which impairs the right
                              ventricle's ability to pump blood to the lungs and
                              makes it more difficult. In this case, fluids
                              refluxe to the abdomen, feet, and legs, causing
                              swelling. <br />
                              3. Systolic heart failure <br />
                              It occurs when the heart muscle becomes weak and
                              loses its ability to contract to pump blood to the
                              body, and this type is more common in men than
                              women. <br />
                              4. Diastolic heart failure <br />
                              In this case, the heart muscle becomes more stiff
                              than normal as a result of other diseases that
                              affect the heart, and the heart loses its ability
                              to relax to be filled with blood, which leads to a
                              lack of blood supply to the rest of the body, and
                              it is more common in women.
