                              Lung cancer is one of the most common types of
                              malignant cancers, which affects the lungs and
                              spreads inside them and can then migrate and
                              spread to the rest of the body. <br />
                              And like malignant tumors, it begins with a
                              disturbance in the growth of cells in the lungs
                              and trachea, where they grow and divide in an
                              abnormally accelerated manner, which leads to the
                              spread of cancer cells and the formation of tumors
                              inside the lungs. <br />
                              Lung cancer is considered one of the fatal
                              cancers, as it is classified as one of the most
                              leading causes to death of all types of cancer,
                              because it destroys the spongy cells of the lungs
                              that supply the body with oxygen and get rid of
                              carbon dioxide so that it can perform its vital
                              functions, and lose them the ability to perform
                              their role. <br />
                              Smoking is the most responsible cause for lung
                              cancer in more than 90% of cases, and non-smokers
                              can also get it, but the risk increases with
                              increasing smoking period.

                              lung cells are destroyed with the first exposure
                              of lung cells to cigarette smoke filled with
                              carcinogens, and here the risk of developing the

                              exposure to damage caused by cigarette smoke, the
                              nature of the cells changes abnormally leading to
                              the formation of cancer cells.

                              1_ Non-small cell lung cancer: <br />
                              It represents 80-85% of lung cancer types, and is
                              divided into several types, most of them respond
                              greatly to treatment if diagnosed in the early
                              stages of the disease. <br />
                              2_ Small cell lung cancer: <br />
                              It represents about 15-20% of lung cancers, and is
                              considered more dangerous than non-small cell lung
                              cancer. <br />

                              If you develop symptoms from those mentioned
                              previously or have some risk factors that can
                              increase lung cancer, you will definitely go to
                              see a doctor to be sure. <br />
                              Diagnosing lung cancer begins with the doctor
                              examining the patient, knowing the symptoms, and
                              taking the full medical history and ordering some
                              tests to prove or deny the disease. <br />
                              1. Examination of blood chemistry. <br />
                              2. Checking the concentration of blood gases.
                              <br />
                              3. Imaging tests: through which tumor masses can
                              be detected

                              5. Laboratory examination of sputum associated

                              6. Taking a biopsy from the lung for examination

                              the cells are cancerous or not. <br />

                              positive, this will require a bone scan to <br />

                              1. Surgical intervention: <br />
                              Surgical intervention is one of the first options,
                              especially in the first or second stage of the
                              disease, the tumor and part of the healthy cells
                              around it are removed, and lymph nodes can also be
                              removed for examination. <br />
                              Chemotherapy or radiotherapy are used before
                              surgery in case of large tumers to reduce its size
                              before excision, and it can also be used after
                              surgical intervention if there is a chance for
                              cancerous cells to return again. <br />
                              2. Radiotherapy: <br />
                              High-energy beams of X-rays and protons are used
                              and directed at tiny points on the body to destroy
                              cancer cells. <br />
                              It may help relieve symptoms associated with
                              cancer, such as pain, and is used before or after
                              surgery and is usually combined with chemotherapy.
                              <br />
                              3. Chemotherapy: <br />
                              These are certain medications taken by mouth or
                              injected into a vein to destroy cancer cells. They
                              are used after surgery to destroy any remaining
                              cancer cells and to prevent them from spreading
                              again. <br />
                              4. Immunotherapy: <br />
                              In some advanced stages of cancer, the body's
                              immune system may be unable to confront cancer
                              cells that adopt a way to escape from the immune
                              system. In these cases, immunotherapy is used to
                              help the body control the disease. <br />
                              5. Palliative care: <br />
                              Lung cancer and the side effects of treatments
                              cause severe and painful symptoms for patients,
                              and it is necessary to focus on some treatment
                              methods to reduce the severity of these symptoms.
                              <br />
                              In addition , some people in the advanced stages
                              of the disease can choose not to complete the
                              treatment plan, this is where the role of
                              palliative care comes in relieving symptoms of the
                              disease rather than treating the cancer itself.

                              Always early diagnosis of any disease increases
                              the rate of cure, as well as in the case of lung
                              cancer. <br />

                              depends on the type of cancer and its stage when
                              it was discovered. The longevity of a lung cancer
                              patient depends on his age, his general health
                              condition, and the extent of the disease’s
                              response to treatment. <br />
                              So, if lung cancer is detected early and the

                              condition, this increases the cure rate and the
                              chance of survival for five years to 50-53%.
